## What is layer2
[Layer 2](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/layer-2) is a secondary framework built on top of a blockchain network (Layer 1). It improves scalability and performance by processing transactions off-chain or on sidechains, reducing fees and increasing transaction throughput. It enhances blockchain usability and enables faster, cheaper transactions without sacrificing security.

## What is NFT metadata
NFT metadata refers to additional information associated with a non-fungible token (NFT). It includes details such as the title, description, image or video files, creators, and other attributes that provide context and value to the NFT. Metadata plays a crucial role in defining the uniqueness and characteristics of an NFT. It allows creators to add rich media, provenance information, and additional content to enhance the overall experience and understanding of the NFT. Metadata can be stored on-chain or in off-chain decentralized storage, ensuring that the information remains linked to the corresponding NFT and can be accessed by anyone interacting with it.
