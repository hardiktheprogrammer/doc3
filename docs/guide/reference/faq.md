# FAQ

## What is the limit of orders for a single wallet? 
Currently, we do not have any limit of orders that you can place. 

## What is the meaning of minimum trading volume should be greater than 1000? 
That means the order price needs to bigger than 0.001 token. 

## Which rollup mechanism is currently used for interaction between layer2 and layer1? What is the timeliness?
Reddio supports two sidechain schemes: validium rollup and zkRollup. Validium rollup stores data on offchain, and zkRollup stores data on the chain. The default is validium rollup.
The timeliness of the two methods is about the same.
The execution time for operations on layer 2 is about 300ms.
And it generally takes more than 8 hours to submit the confirmation proof on layer 2 to layer 1.
For more information about zkRollup, please refer to the official document: [how does layer 2 works](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/reference/how-does-layer-2-works.html).

## What is the time required for deposit on layer2? How to check whether the operation was successful?

In order to prevent the block from having reorg. General exchanges set 12 to 30 blocks for confirmation.
Currently Reddio is set to 15 block confirmations. It takes about 150-200s.
We can obtain notifications of operation results by querying the [balance](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/api-reference/balance.html) API or [record](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/api-reference/record.html) API.

## How long does it take for a layer 2 operation’s proof to be published on the blockchain?
It takes 8-16 hours for the status proof of all layer 2 operations to be publish on the blockchain.
However, users don’t need to care much about when the proof to layer 1 because the status of layer2 operations is returned in real time.  They only need to care about the proof to be published on layer 1 when they try to withdraw funds from layer 2 to layer 1.

## How does Reddio achieve recharge funds from layer1 to layer2?
When the user recharges, the users’ assets are recharged to the starkex contract on layer 1.
The contract address for starkex on ethreum mainnet is 0x8eb82154f314ec687957ce1e9c1a5dc3a3234df9.
The contract address for starkex on goerli testnet is 0x8eb82154f314ec687957ce1e9c1a5dc3a3234df9.
Reddio is monitoring the starkex contract on layer1. Waiting for recharge event coming in.
When a recharge event occurs and is confirmed by 15 blocks. The corresponding starkkey assets will be recharged to layer2. Therefore, users can use their assets on layer2.

## When can I received the funds on layer 2 after deposit/withdraw operations?
Deposit will generally be completed 3 minutes after the deposit operation, so we recommend querying the funding status every 30 seconds
Withdraw is generally completed within 8 hour after the withdraw operation, so we recommend querying the funding status every half an hour. We need to note that the once the withdraw is completed, that means the proof of withdraw on layer 2 is submitted to layer 1. It also means that the corresponding assets can be withdrawn on layer1 to the user's layer1 wallet.

## Do Reddio support mint NFTs on layer 2?
Yes, Reddio supports mint NFTs on layer 2.
You can refer to [Mint NFTs on layer 2](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/getting-started/mint-nfts-on-layer-2.html) tutorial to learn how to mint NFTs.

## How to check contract details and transactions details on layer 1?
You can query through third-party websites such as etherscan.
You can know how to view these data through [tutorial](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/getting-started/check-your-eth-erc20-nft-balance.html).

## When I use API to mint NFTs. What does response: minting is not supported for ERC721 mean?
In Reddio’s system, we classified the ERC721 contract into two types.
ERC721 is specially used for users that have completed mint operations on Ethereum. They wish to switch their NFT collections trading to layer2. For this kind of NFTs, we are not allowed to mint on layer 2. And users will see the above error.
ERC721M is a type of contract that can be used for minting on layer2. If you use ERC721M instead of ERC721 in this situation, the above error will not be seen.
Please refer to [Mint NFTs On Layer 2](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/getting-started/mint-nfts-on-layer-2.html) for more detail.

## What is the purpose of nonce in Reddio’s system?
The nonce is mainly used to prevent replay attacks.  A transaction will automatically add the number of nonce for a specific stark_key by one just like what Ethereum does.
You can consult with the introduction document about the [principle of nonce](https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/5461509-what-is-a-nonce).

## Does SDK wallets generated functions always lead to the same key pairs?
Not necessarily, it all depends on the generation algorithm you use.
If you generate the stark_key pair by the same Ethereum private key, the results are always the same. Since they are generated by the same Ethereum private key with the same signature.
However, If you generate the stark_key pair by a random function, such as the get_random_private_key function in the Unity SDK. It will use algorithm to ensure that the wallet will not be repeated just like how wallet key generation works on layer 1. Therfore, you will not get the same stark_key pairs in this way.

## Why I get 0 when using getnonce function?
If getnonce function returns 0, it means that this stark_key does not have any active transaction. When there is an active transaction related to the stark_key, the nonce will automatically increase. For more information about nonce, please refer to [this discussion](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/reference/faq.html#what-is-the-purpose-of-nonce-in-reddio%E2%80%99s-system).

## What is the length of stark_key?
Stark_key is a hexadecimal address starting with 0x and followed by 63 characters or less than 63 characters.

## What is the minimum amount for ETH/ERC20 withdrawal?
The minimum withdrawal unit for ETH and ERC20 is 1 "quantum", which is 0.000001 units. Therefore, you need to withdraw at least 0.000001 units of tokens at a time.

## What is assetid？
Assetid is an unique identifier calculated based on the asset type (ETH, ERC20, ERC721), contract address, and tokenID. This identifier corresponds layer 2 assets to layer 1 assets one by one. It should be noted that if the asset type is ERC20 or ETH, tokenID will not be used as the calculation parameter of assetid.

## What does the expirationTimeStamp parameter mean?
The expirationTimeStamp parameter represents the timeout for deposit/transfer/withdraw operations. Once the processing time of this operation on layer2 exceeds this value, the operation will fail. The unit of this parameter is second (unixtimestamp/3600). The default value and maximum value of this parameter are both 4194303. If you use default value as parameter,  this operation will never expire.

## What should I put in the base URI?
Base URI is used for you to fill in the metadata of your NFT collection. The metadata will contain information such as pictures and attributes corresponding to the NFTs. See the [Set Up Metadata For Your NFTs](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/getting-started/set-up-metadata-for-your-nfts.html) documentation for more details.

## What is the mechanism behind transfering tokens between layer 2 and layer1?
The current Reddio service is based on StarkEx, we can explain it from the two operations：deposit and withdraw. For Deposit, when you deposit assets  (including ERC20/ETH/ERC721) from layer1 to a certain stark_key, Reddio will change the asset status of this stark_key on layer2, and will synchronize the asset status to StarkEx. StarkEx will verify the ownership of the asset later (by comparing the asset status on layer 1 and Reddio’s synchronize status). For Withdraw, the user needs to initiate a withdraw request on layer2. When reddio processes the request, it will update the asset status and synchronize the withdraw request to starkex. After StarkEx verifies, the asset will be released after 8-16 hours. The hash of the asset statis is uploaded to the chain. At the same time, StarkEx will change the withdrawal balance of the user on the chain. After the change you can claim your assets on layer1. See [this](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex/overview.html) for more details

## How does Reddio charge? 
Currently, Reddio only charges after the user places an order and completes the transaction. The fee rate is 0.5% of the total price of the pending order. And  this fee is only charged to the seller (maker).

## Can the royalty of NFT be customized in Reddio?
It is not possible on our system currently.

## Is there any fee for withdrawing assets from layer 2?
The withdrawal process can be divided into two steps. The first step is to withdraw on layer2, and the user does not need to pay any fees for this step. After completing the previous step, the second step of withdrawal occurs on layer 1. The user who performs the withdraw operation  on layer 1 needs to pay the gas fee to the relevant blockchain network. Reddio will not charge any fee during the whole process.

## How to make ERC721 contract support minting on layer 2？
You need to make sure you include the MintFor function in your ERC721 contract. You can check [this](https://github.com/reddio-com/contract_demo/blob/main/src/contracts/ERC721MintFor.sol#L82) for implementing MintFor function. Only in this way can mint NFTs on layer 2 be guaranteed.

## Will completed orders still be in the order API? Where can I find it?
Completed orders will no longer appear in the order API. Because the orders in the order API are rders that have not yet been filled. If you want to query the orders that have been filled, you can query through the [record API](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/api-reference/record.html).

## How to know which wallet bought specific NFT?
You can query the the NFT collection API to figure out who bought specific NFT. Here is an [query example](https://api.reddio.com/v1/contracts/0x8fc67b0fcc9283551bdcd4d2d0b7c886f0756e64/tokens).

## What are the possible reasons that pending orders are not filled?
One possible reason is that the seller and buyer of the pending order are the same . In order to prevent order fraud, the pending order will only be filled if the buyer and the seller are not the same. Otherwise, user's assets will be frozen. You can cancel the old orders by cancel_order API.

## What does 'frozen_token_ids' mean in balance APIs?
Frozen_token_ids represents the assets of the NFT collection have been frozen for some reason. If the asset is in pending order, the system will automatically freeze the asset to which the token_id belongs.
