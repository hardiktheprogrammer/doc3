# FAQ

## What is the limit of orders for a single wallet? 
Currently, we do not have any limit of orders that you can place. 

## What is the meaning of minimum trading volume should be greater than 1000? 
That means the order price needs to bigger than 0.001 token. 

## Which rollup mechanism is currently used for interaction between layer2 and layer1? What is the timeliness?
Reddio supports two sidechain schemes: validium rollup and zkRollup. Validium rollup stores data on offchain, and zkRollup stores data on the chain. The default is validium rollup.
The timeliness of the two methods is about the same.
The execution time for operations on layer 2 is about 300ms.
And it generally takes more than 8 hours to submit the confirmation proof on layer 2 to layer 1.
For more information about zkRollup, please refer to the official document: [how does layer 2 works](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/reference/how-does-layer-2-works.html).

## What is the time required for deposit on layer2? How to check whether the operation was successful?

In order to prevent the block from having reorg. General exchanges set 12 to 30 blocks for confirmation.
Currently Reddio is set to 15 block confirmations. It takes about 150-200s.
We can obtain notifications of operation results by querying the [balance](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/api-reference/balance.html) API or [record](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/api-reference/record.html) API.

## How long does it take for a layer 2 operation’s proof to be published on the blockchain?
It takes 8-16 hours for the status proof of all layer 2 operations to be publish on the blockchain.
However, users don’t need to care much about when the proof to layer 1 because the status of layer2 operations is returned in real time.  They only need to care about the proof to be published on layer 1 when they try to withdraw funds from layer 2 to layer 1.

## How does Reddio achieve recharge funds from layer1 to layer2?
When the user recharges, the users’ assets are recharged to the starkex contract on layer 1.
The contract address for starkex on ethreum mainnet is 0x8eb82154f314ec687957ce1e9c1a5dc3a3234df9.
The contract address for starkex on goerli testnet is 0x8eb82154f314ec687957ce1e9c1a5dc3a3234df9.
Reddio is monitoring the starkex contract on layer1. Waiting for recharge event coming in.
When a recharge event occurs and is confirmed by 15 blocks. The corresponding starkkey assets will be recharged to layer2. Therefore, users can use their assets on layer2.

## When can I received the funds on layer 2 after deposit/withdraw operations?
Deposit will generally be completed 3 minutes after the deposit operation, so we recommend querying the funding status every 30 seconds
Withdraw is generally completed within 8 hour after the withdraw operation, so we recommend querying the funding status every half an hour. We need to note that the once the withdraw is completed, that means the proof of withdraw on layer 2 is submitted to layer 1. It also means that the corresponding assets can be withdrawn on layer1 to the user's layer1 wallet.

## Do Reddio support mint NFTs on layer 2?
Yes, Reddio supports mint NFTs on layer 2.
You can refer to [Mint NFTs on layer 2](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/getting-started/mint-nfts-on-layer-2.html) tutorial to learn how to mint NFTs.

## How to check contract details and transactions details on layer 1?
You can query through third-party websites such as etherscan.
You can know how to view these data through [tutorial](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/getting-started/check-your-eth-erc20-nft-balance.html).

## When I use API to mint NFTs. What does response: minting is not supported for ERC721 mean?
In Reddio’s system, we classified the ERC721 contract into two types.
ERC721 is specially used for users that have completed mint operations on Ethereum. They wish to switch their NFT collections trading to layer2. For this kind of NFTs, we are not allowed to mint on layer 2. And users will see the above error.
ERC721M is a type of contract that can be used for minting on layer2. If you use ERC721M instead of ERC721 in this situation, the above error will not be seen.
Please refer to [Mint NFTs On Layer 2](https://docs.reddio.com/guide/getting-started/mint-nfts-on-layer-2.html) for more detail.

## What is the purpose of nonce in Reddio’s system?
The nonce is mainly used to prevent replay attacks.  A transaction will automatically add the number of nonce for a specific stark_key by one just like what Ethereum does.
You can consult with the introduction document about the [principle of nonce](https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/5461509-what-is-a-nonce).

## Does SDK wallets generated functions always lead to the same key pairs?
Not necessarily, it all depends on the generation algorithm you use.
If you generate the stark_key pair by the same Ethereum private key, the results are always the same. Since they are generated by the same Ethereum private key with the same signature.
However, If you generate the stark_key pair by a random function, such as the get_random_private_key function in the Unity SDK. It will use algorithm to ensure that the wallet will not be repeated just like how wallet key generation works on layer 1. Therfore, you will not get the same stark_key pairs in this way.
