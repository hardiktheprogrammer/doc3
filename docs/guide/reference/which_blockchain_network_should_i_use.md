# Which Blockchain Network Should I Use?

## Introduction

In this article, we will provide you following aspects of blockchain networks:

1. What is Ethereum mainnet and Goerli testnet?
2. Why shall we use testnet before deploying on mainnet?
3. How can I get free Goerli ETH to test my applications?

## What is Ethereum mainnet and Goerli testnet?

Ethereum mainnet is the primary network where actual transactions and operations take place on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized network that is maintained by a global network of nodes, and it is designed to be secure, reliable, and resistant to censorship. Ethereum mainnet is where real Ether (ETH) is used and where Ethereum-based applications and smart contracts are deployed and run.

Goerli testnet, on the other hand, is an Ethereum testnet that was launched in 2019. It was created as a response to the instability of other Ethereum testnets, such as Rinkeby and Ropsten, which were often prone to network congestion and spam attacks. Goerli is designed to be more stable, reliable, and resistant to spam attacks than other testnets, making it a good choice for testing Ethereum applications and smart contracts.

## Why shall we use testnet before deploying on mainnet?

The first reason to use a testnet before deploying on mainnet is that deploying a smart contract on mainnet can be very expensive in terms of gas fees. testnets like Goerli allow developers to test their smart contracts without incurring these high costs, which helps them optimize their code and minimize gas usage before deploying on Mainnet. 

The second reason to use testnet before deploying on mainnet is that blockchain applications cannot be changed or modified after they are uploaded to the blockchain. Without thoroughly testing the application or smart contract on a testnet, it can be risky to deploy it on mainnet where mistakes can be costly and difficult to fix. 

For example, let's say you have created a smart contract that is supposed to hold funds in escrow until a certain condition is met. If you deploy this contract on mainnet without thoroughly testing it on a testnet, there is a risk that the smart contract has a bug that could result in the funds being released prematurely or not at all. If this happens, it could result in a loss of funds or legal disputes with your clients. However, if you test the smart contract on a testnet like Goerli before deploying it on mainnet , you can identify and fix any such bugs before they cause any damage. This can save you time, money, and headaches down the line.

## How can I get free Goerli ETH to test my applications?

There are two ways to obtain free Goerli test ETH tokens:

First, if you've deployed one or more contracts on Ethereum(mainnet)/Goerli/Sepolia before November 15th, 2022, you're eligible to claim 10 Goerli and Sepolia test ETH tokens in a one-time event.  For more information, visit **[https://collect-test-eth.org](https://collect-test-eth.org/)**.

Second, you can visit [https://goerlifaucet.com/](https://goerlifaucet.com/) once every 24 hours to receive 0.2 ETH in Goerli test tokens.

If you still have difficuties about obtaining test ETH, don't hesitate to contact us on Discord. We'll be happy to provide you with some. Click here to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/kBPNmk2GS4).
