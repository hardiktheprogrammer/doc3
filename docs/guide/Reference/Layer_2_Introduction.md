# Layer 2 Introduction

Layer 2 is a collective term to describe a specific set of layer 1 scaling solutions. A layer 2 is a separate blockchain that extends layer 1 and inherits the security guarantees of layer 1.

Layer 2 solutions are needed, both to immediately improve the congestion on the current layer 1 network, and to set the stage for mass adoption in the post-ETH 2.0 era for ETH and other layer 1 networks.

With layer 2, there are quite a few benefits,

- Lower gas fees
    - By combining multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, transaction fees are massively reduced
- Mainnet security
    - Layer 2 blockchains settle their transactions on Mainnet, allowing users to benefit from the security of the layer 1 network.
- Expand use cases
    - With higher transactions per second, lower fees, and new technology, projects will expand into new applications with improved user experience.
