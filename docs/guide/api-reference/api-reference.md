# **API Reference**

The Reddio API is organized around **[REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)**. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts **[form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms)** request bodies, returns **[JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/)** responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the Reddio API in testnet at api-dev.reddio.com , which doesn't affect your live data or interact with the mainnet. And you can switch to [api.reddio.com](http://api.reddio.com) for production/mainnet.
